# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis — Power BI & SQL Project
> **Why This Project Stands Out:** A complete **end-to-end data analytics solution** integrating Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover actionable insights into retail shopping patterns.  
> It transforms raw customer transaction data into a visually interactive dashboard revealing spending habits, loyalty behavior, and revenue opportunities.

---

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes **customer shopping behavior** using transactional data from **3,900 purchases** across multiple product categories.  
The goal is to identify **spending patterns, customer segments, and product preferences** while providing recommendations to increase **subscriptions, loyalty, and revenue**.

The project demonstrates the **entire analytics lifecycle**:
- Data cleaning and transformation in **Python**  
- Business analysis and querying in **PostgreSQL**  
- Interactive visualization and storytelling in **Power BI**

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **data preparation, cleaning, and feature engineering** using Python.  
- Execute **SQL queries** for business analysis and segmentation.  
- Design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for decision-making insights.  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve marketing, customer retention, and profitability.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details
| Dataset/Table | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Customer` | Customer demographics — Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status |
| `Purchase` | Product information — Item, Category, Season, Size, Color, Price |
| `Transaction` | Purchase details — Discount Applied, Promo Code, Frequency, Review Rating, Shipping Type |

**Rows:** 3,900  **Columns:** 18  **Missing Data:** 37 null values in `Review Rating`

### **Key Attributes**
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status  
- **Purchase Details:** Item, Category, Amount, Season, Size, Color  
- **Behavioral Data:** Discount usage, Promo codes, Purchase frequency, Shipping preference

---

## 🧭 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Imported dataset using `pandas` and explored using `.info()` and `.describe()`.  
2. **Missing Value Treatment:** Imputed missing `Review Rating` using **median per product category**.  
3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created `age_group` from customer ages.  
   - Derived `purchase_frequency_days` from purchase history.  
4. **Column Standardization:** Converted to `snake_case` for clarity.  
5. **Database Integration:** Loaded cleaned data into **PostgreSQL** for SQL analysis.  
6. **SQL Analysis:** Derived insights on revenue, segments, and behavior.  
7. **Visualization:** Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to present results visually.

## 🧠 Business Analysis using SQL
| Analysis | Objective |
|-----------|------------|
| **Revenue by Gender** | Compare total revenue generated by male vs. female customers |
| **High-Spending Discount Users** | Identify customers using discounts but spending above average |
| **Top 5 Products by Rating** | Discover products with the highest review ratings |
| **Shipping Type Comparison** | Compare spending between Standard and Express shipping |
| **Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers** | Measure revenue and average spend by subscription status |
| **Discount-Dependent Products** | Identify products most purchased with discounts |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Categorize customers as New, Returning, or Loyal |
| **Top Products per Category** | List top-selling items within each category |
| **Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions** | Analyze relationship between frequent buyers and subscription status |
| **Revenue by Age Group** | Evaluate revenue contribution across age groups |

## 📊 Dashboard in Power BI

An interactive **Customer Behavior Dashboard** was developed in Power BI to showcase major KPIs, including revenue, subscription trends, and customer demographics.

### **Dashboard Highlights**
- **3.9K Customers** analyzed  
- **$59.76** average purchase amount  
- **3.75** average review rating  
- Subscription Status: **Yes – 27% | No – 73%**  
- Visual comparisons by **Category, Age Group, Gender, and Shipping Type**
